# Survival-Analysis
The purpose of this project is to present two models, one with logistic regression to see how certain financial variables impact a companyâ€™s probability of default, and another model to predict the expected time to bankruptcy for any given company.

From the two analyses conducted - one which uses logistic regression to predict if a company will go bankrupt in the future based on four variables, Net Debt to EBITDA, Profit Margin, Current Ratio, and EBITDA, and another model which uses survival analysis to predict how many years it will take until a company goes bankrupt which will utilize 3 variables, Profit Margin, Net Debt to EBITDA, and Current Ratio.
